# fb-explorer

fb-explorer is a web app that allows a user to log into Facebook, download their data, drop it in, and explore it in a sleek dashboard that doesn't collect any information.

fb-explorer is still under construction as I am working towards MVP

MVP:
- [x] User can log into facebook
- [x] User is taken to page where they can download their data
- [x] All data categories can be selected and displayed with keys and values present
- [ ] Compress the data cards down with a dropdown that holds all of the relevant information for a given piece of data (timestamp, comment, author, etc)
- [ ] User can filter through data by date/length
- [ ] User can search through data values

Features beyond MVP:
- [ ] Master search for values across categories
- [ ] Allow user to also drop in HTML data and render the exact data pages
- [ ] User can log into facebook
- [ ] Allow user to export their personal dashboard instance and install it locally (user's data will NEVER be stored or saved by this app)
