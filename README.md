# fb-explorer

fb-explorer is a web app that allows a user to log into Facebook, download their data, drop it in, and explore it in it's native html format! 

# This app does not collect or store any of your personal information or Facebook data

fb-explorer is still under construction as I am working towards MVP

MVP:
- [x] User can log into facebook
- [x] User is taken to page where they can download their data
- [x] Data is being parsed, organized, and stored in global state.
- [x] User can explore the index with all of their data categories
- [x] User can click on a SPECIFIC category and be routed to that page where that categories html is rendered for them
- [x] Get photos/videos to render correctly in the html
- [x] Optimize preformance and fix broken img/video links
- [x] Make the app fully responsive
- [ ] Fix all tiny bugs, warnings, and remove unused libraries/packages

Features beyond MVP:
- [ ] Master search for values across categories
- [ ] Integrate with Blockstack Auth and Blockstack Gaia so user can save encrypt and save their data in the cloud and protect it with their personal key
